# 🚀 Railsway TimescaleDB HA & Proxy

### _Enterprise-Grade Time-Series Cluster for Railway_

A premium, production-ready TimescaleDB (Postgres 16) template featuring a centralized connection proxy, automatic Read/Write splitting, and high-availability (HA).

---

## 🏛️ System Architecture

This template deploys a robust 3-node architecture designed for maximum performance and reliability:

1.  **🛰️ Timescale Proxy (Pgpool-II)**:
    - **Unified Endpoint**: Connect to a single host; the proxy handles everything else.
    - **Auto R/W Splitting**: Routes Writes to Primary and Reads to Replica.
    - **Auto Failback**: Automatically re-attaches nodes once they become healthy.
2.  **👑 Timescale Primary (Master)**:
    - Optimized for **Write Operations**. Handles replication management.
    - Auto-syncs credentials with Railway environment variables.
3.  **👥 Timescale Replica (Standby)**:
    - Dedicated **Read Node**. Synchronizes in real-time.
    - Offloads heavy query workloads from the master.

## 🔌 Connection Guide (วิธีการเชื่อมต่อ)

### 1. 🛡️ Internal / Private Connection (เชื่อมต่อภายใน Railway)

Recommended for your backend applications running within the same Railway project.

- **Host**: `timescale-proxy.railway.internal`
- **Port**: `5432`
- **User**: `postgres` (or as configured in `POSTGRES_USER`)
- **Password**: Your `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}`
- **Database**: Your `${POSTGRES_DB}`

### 2. 🌍 External / Public Connection (เชื่อมต่อจากภายนอก)

Use this for DBeaver, TablePlus, or local development.

- **Step 1**: Go to your **timescale-proxy** service in Railway.
- **Step 2**: Click **Settings** > **Public Networking** > **TCP Proxy**.
- **Step 3**: Use the provided Public Domain and Port (e.g., `monorail.proxy.rlwy.net:12345`).
- **Connection String**:
  `postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@monorail.proxy.rlwy.net:PORT/postgres`

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ Zero-Config Auto-Tuning**: Automatically applies `timescaledb-tune` based on defined resources.
- **🔄 Real-time Streaming Replication**: Data is synced instantly via physical replication slots.
- **🛡️ High Availability**: The proxy continuously monitors node health and handles failover.
- **� Password Auto-Sync**: If you change `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in Railway, the cluster updates itself automatically on redeploy.

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Verification

### Check Replication Status

Connect to the **Primary** node and run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;
```

### Check Proxy Node Status

Connect to the **Proxy** node and run:

```sql
show pool_nodes;
```

- `status` 1 = **UP** (Healthy)
- `status` 3 = **DOWN** (Offline/Syncing)

## Why Deploy TimescaleDB Replica (PostgreSQL) on Railway?

Railway is a singular platform to deploy your infrastructure stack. Railway will host your infrastructure so you don't have to deal with configuration, while allowing you to vertically and horizontally scale it.

By deploying TimescaleDB Replica (PostgreSQL) on Railway, you are one step closer to supporting a complete full-stack application with minimal burden. Host your servers, databases, AI agents, and more on Railway.

## 📈 Optimization Pro-Tips

```sql
-- 🧊 Compression Policy: Save ~90% storage
SELECT add_compression_policy('your_metrics_table', INTERVAL '7 days');

-- 🏎️ Continuous Aggregates: Real-time lightning-fast reports
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_stats WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS ...
```
